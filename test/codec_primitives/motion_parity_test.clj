;; Parity between the original malli-backed `codec-primitives.motion/valid-mv?`
;; and the Kotoba port at `src/codec_primitives/motion.kotoba`.
;;
;; The original validated a plain Clojure map against a malli schema and
;; answered true/false. The Kotoba port expresses the same shape as the
;; parameter's type, so on that side "validation" happens as typed value
;; admission at the runtime boundary: a well-shaped motion vector is admitted
;; (and the predicate answers true); a malformed one cannot be admitted at all
;; and execution traps. This test pins that agreement on both sides:
;;
;;   * for every map the original accepts, the compiled object admits the
;;     equivalent typed value and answers true;
;;   * for every map the original rejects, the equivalent attempt to build a
;;     typed value for the compiled object traps.
;;
;; The kotoba side runs through the real compiler + KIR interpreter
;; (`kotoba.compiler.core` / `kotoba.kir`), the same path
;; aiueos/tcp-seq-acceptable-parity-test uses, so this is evidence about the
;; compiled artifact, not about source text.
